>Machine learning is the subfield of computer science that gives "computers the ability to learn **without being explicitly programmed**.”

In essence, machine learning follows the same process that a 4-year-old child uses to learn, understand, and differentiate animals. So, machine learning algorithms, inspired by the human learning process, iteratively learn from data, and allow computers to find hidden insights.



- How do you think Netflix and Amazon recommend videos, movies, and TV shows to its users? They use Machine Learning to produce suggestions that you might enjoy! This is similar to how your friends might recommend a television show to you, based on their knowledge of the types of shows you like to watch. 
- How do you think banks make a decision when approving a loan application? They use machine learning to predict the probability of default for each applicant, and then approve or refuse the loan application based on that probability. 
- Telecommunication companies use their customers’ demographic data to segment them, or predict if they will unsubscribe from their company the next month.



**Major machine learning techniques**:

| techniques | applications |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Regression/Estimation** | Predicting continuous values |
| **Classification** | Predicting the item class/category of a case |
| **Clustering** | Finding the structure of data; summarization |
| **Associations** | Associating frequent co-occurring items/events |
| **Anomaly detection** | Discovering abnormal and unusual cases |
| **Sequence mining** | Predicting next events; click-stream (Markov Model, HMM) |
| **Dimension Reduction** | Reducing the size of data (PCA) |
| **Recommendation systems** | Recommending items |


>“What is the difference between these buzzwords that we keep hearing these days, such as Artificial intelligence (or AI), Machine Learning and Deep Learning?” 

- In brief, AI tries to make computers intelligent in order to mimic the cognitive functions of humans. So, Artificial Intelligence is a general field with a broad scope including: Computer Vision, Language Processing, Creativity, and Summarization. 
- Machine Learning is the branch of AI that covers the statistical part of artificial intelligence. It teaches the computer to solve problems by looking at hundreds or thousands of examples, learning from them, and then using that experience to solve the same problem in new situations. 
- And Deep Learning is a very special field of Machine Learning where computers can actually learn and make intelligent decisions on their own. Deep learning involves a deeper level of automation in comparison with most machine learning algorithms.
