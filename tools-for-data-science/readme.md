## Languages of Data Science

### Python

1. Python is a high-level **general-purpose programming language** that can be applied to many different classes of problems. 
2. It has a **large standard library** that provides tools suited to many different tasks, including but not limited to databases, automation, web scraping, text processing, image processing, machine learning, and data analytics. 
3. For **data science**, you can use Python's scientific computing libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. 
4. For **artificial intelligence**, it has TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, and Scikit-learn. 
5. Python can also be used for **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).


### R

Like Python, R is free to use, but it's a GNU project -- instead of being open source, it's actually free software. 

So if Python is open source and R is free software, what’s the difference?  
- Both open source and free software commonly refer to the same set of licenses. Many open source projects use the GNU General Public License, for example. 
- Both open source and free software support collaboration. In many cases (but not all), these terms can be used interchangeably. 
- The Open Source Initiative (OSI) champions open source while the Free Software Foundation (FSF) defines free software. 
- Open source is more business focused, while free software is more focused on a set of values.


### SQL

The SQL language is subdivided into several language elements, including clauses, expressions, predicates, queries, and statements.

- Knowing SQL will help you do many different jobs in data science, including business and data analyst, and it's a must in data engineering and data science. 
- When performing operations with SQL, you access the data directly. There's no need to copy it beforehand. This can speed up workflow executions considerably. 
- SQL is the interpreter between you and the database. 
- SQL is an ANSI standard, which means if you learn SQL and use it with one database, you will be able to easily apply that SQL knowledge to many other databases.


### Java

- Java is a tried-and-true **general-purpose object oriented programming language**. 
- It's been widely adopted in the **enterprise space** and is designed to be fast and scalable. 
- Java applications are compiled to **bytecode** and run on the **Java Virtual Machine**, or "JVM." 
- Some notable data science tools built with Java include 
  - **Weka**, for data mining; 
  - **Java-ML**, which is a machine learning library; 
  - **Apache MLlib**, which makes machine learning scalable; 
  - **Deeplearning4j**, for deep learning.
- Apache **Hadoop** is another Java-built application. It manages data processing and storage for big data applications running in clustered systems.

### Scala

- Scala is a **general-purpose** programming language that provides support for **functional programming** and a strong static type system. 
- Designed as an extension to Java. Many of the design decisions in the construction of the Scala language were made to address criticisms of Java. Scala is also **inter-operable** with Java, as it runs on the JVM. 
- The name "Scala" is a combination of "scalable" and "language." This language is designed to grow along with the demands of its users. 
- For data science, the most popular program built using Scala is **Apache Spark**. 
  - Spark is a fast and general-purpose cluster computing system. It provides APIs that make parallel jobs easy to write, and an optimized engine that supports general computation graphs. 
  - **Shark**, which is a query engine; 
  - **MLlib**, for machine learning; 
  - **GraphX**, for graph processing; and 
  - **Spark Streaming**. 
  - Designed to be faster than Hadoop.


### C++

- C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It is an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes.” 
- C++ improves processing speed, enables system programming, and provides broader control over the software application. 
- Many organizations that use Python or other high-level languages for data analysis and exploratory tasks still rely on C++ to develop programs that feed that data to customers in real-time. 
- For data science, 
  - a popular deep learning library for dataflow called **TensorFlow** was built with C++. But while C++ is the foundation of TensorFlow, it runs on a Python interface, so you don’t need to know C++ to use it. 
  - **MongoDB**, a NoSQL database for big data management, was built with C++. 
  - **Caffe** is a deep learning algorithm repository built with C++, with Python and MATLAB bindings.


### JavaScript

- A core technology for the World Wide Web, JavaScript is a general-purpose language that extended beyond the browser with the creation of **Node.js** and other server-side approaches. 
- Javascript is NOT related to the Java language. 
- For data science, the most popular implementation is undoubtedly TensorFlow.js. 
  - **TensorFlow.js** makes machine learning and deep learning possible in Node.js as well as in the browser. 
    - TensorFlow.js was also adopted by other open source libraries, including brain.js and machinelearn.js.
  - The **R-js** project is another great implementation of JavaScript for data science. R-js has re-written linear algebra specifications from the R Language into Typescript. This re-write will provide a foundation for other projects to implement more powerful math base frameworks like Numpy and SciPy of Python.
- Typescript is a superset of JavaScript.


### Julia

- Julia was designed at MIT for **high-performance** numerical analysis and computational science. 
- It provides **speedy development** like Python or R, while producing programs that run as fast as C or Fortran programs. 
- Julia is **compiled**, which means that the code is executed directly on the processor as executable code; it calls C, Go, Java, MATLAB, R, Fortran, and Python libraries; and has **refined parallelism**. 
- The Julia language is relatively new, having been written in 2012, but it has a lot of promise for future impact on the data science industry. 
  - **JuliaDB** is a particularly useful application of Julia for data science. It's a package for working with large persistent data sets.
