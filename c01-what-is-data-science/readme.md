### Deep Learning and Machine Learning

**Data Science** is the process and method for extracting knowledge and insights from large volumes of disparate data. It **involves** mathematics, statistical analysis, data visualization machine learning and more. It could use machine learning algorithms and deep learning models. It's a broad term encompasses the entire data processing methodology.

**AI** includes everything that allows computers to learn how to solve problems and make intelligent decision. 

Both AI and Data Science can involve the use of **Big Data**.


**Summary**:
- The differences between some common Data Science terms, including Deep Learning and Machine Learning.
- Deep Learning is a type of Machine Learning that simulates human decision-making using neural networks.
- Machine Learning has many applications, from recommender systems that provide relevant choices for customers on commercial websites, to detailed analysis of financial markets.
- How to use regression to analyze data.
